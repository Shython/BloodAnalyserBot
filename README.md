# BloodAnalyserBot

trying to work on implementing a non-invasive method for blood group detection and other parameters like haemoglobin and glucose level. 
utlising an opt101 sensor for the same. 
can possibly detect A,B,AB and O group but not the sign. 
based on the fact that different blood groups give out different voltages on reaction with light of a particular wavelength.
